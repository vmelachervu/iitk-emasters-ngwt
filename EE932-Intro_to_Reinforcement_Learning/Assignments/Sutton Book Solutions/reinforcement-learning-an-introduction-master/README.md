# Sutton & Barto Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my personal Sutton & Barto exercise solutions. Each subfolder contains a pdf file with questions and answers and python scripts for programming exercises.   

Solutions are for personnel reference. No guarantee of correctness is provided. 

Corrections are welcome...

I also created  [rl-algo](https://github.com/habanoz/rl-algo) repository for RL Control algorithm implementations.

## More On RL

If you are interested in **Deep RL**, check out the Berkeley YouTube Deep RL course by Sergey Levine. The course is a precious resource. You can also refer to my solutions to the course assignments at [Berkeley RL Homework Answers](https://github.com/habanoz/berkeley_rl_hw_answers).

If you are interested in **Meta-RL**, check out the Standford YouTube Meta Learning course by Chealse Finn. The course is a precious resource. You can also refer to my solutions to the course assignments at [Standford Meta Learning Homework Answers](https://github.com/habanoz/cs330-2021-stanford-meta-learning-hw-answers).

I leveraged the great work of [ShangtongZhang](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction) to improve may solutions to programming exercises. Sometimes I just used a modified version of his work. Credits are kept.

Please prefer the mentioned works over mine.
